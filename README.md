# ðŸ’– How to run code

## 1.  Install the required libraries using the command below:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 2. Run the code using the command below:

### To train linear and non-linear models
```bash
python train.py
```
### To run the models on the test set.
```bash
python utils.py
```
### Input parameters from the keyboard for prediction with final model.
```bash
python predict.py
```
## 3. Choose the model you want to run from the list of available models in the code.

## 4. Input the required parameters when prompted. The code will then run the selected model and display the results.

### Note
- After running the code, the trained models will be saved in the `models/` directory. You can load these models on Google Drive at link [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1nMeRZxAm8O-InNP7UvCb0tsuvo7ii0ym?fbclid=IwY2xjawJsqNhleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHq1jUhRKirHKiB-v_hXWifXtYLMeJeTzzNSWILs3enULqM_eAclUijvJINn0_aem_3yZdkM9mTUZxqzNfE1E-sg) for use.
- In each folder after run `train.py` and `utils.py`, will have results_summary.csv and results_on_test.csv files. These files contain the results of MAE of each model.
